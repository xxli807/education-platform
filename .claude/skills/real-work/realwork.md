description: Use when planning a multi-step task or working in plan mode and you need to capture the plan as a durable, resumable artifact — breaking work into phases with per-item checkboxes, completion tracking, autonomous verification, and a handoff summary so a future agent can pick up where you left off. Use when user wants to create or design a plan or mentioned "real work".

# Real Work

Turn planning into a durable, resumable artifact. The plan file — not the
conversation — is the source of truth: it records what to do, what's done, how it
was verified, and how to deploy. Any future agent can resume from it with zero
prior context.

**Use when** planning multi-step / multi-session work that may outlive the current
session. Skip for trivial single-session tasks.

## 1. Reach complete understanding first

Do **not** write the plan until scope is fully understood. Relentlessly ask the
user questions until you both share a complete understanding with **no gaps** —
treat an unasked question as a future bug.

- Don't stop at the first round; keep going until no ambiguity, assumption, or
  open decision remains. Probe edges: scope boundaries (in/out), dependencies,
  constraints, success criteria, data, environments, deployment, failure cases.
- Surface every assumption for the user to confirm. If an answer opens a new
  unknown, ask the follow-up — drill down recursively.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for concrete choices. When done, summarize the full scope
  back and only proceed once the user confirms nothing is missing.

## 2. Write the plan

Save to `plans/<descriptive-name>.md` in the **repository root** (create `plans/`
if needed). Use this self-documenting template:

```markdown
# <Work Title>

<1-2 sentence goal and scope.>

## For Future Agents

As work proceeds: mark checkboxes `- [x]` as items complete; when a phase is done,
set its status to `Complete` and write its **Phase Summary** (what was done, key
decisions, anything needed to continue with zero context); run the phase's
**Verification Plan** and record the result before moving on. When all phases are
done, fill in **Final Recap** and **Deployment Plan**.

## Phase 1: <Title>

Status: Not started <!-- Not started | In progress | Complete -->

- [ ] <concrete, actionable item>
- [ ] <concrete, actionable item>

### Verification Plan

- <command/check the agent can run autonomously, with expected result>

### Phase Summary

_(write when phase completes)_

## Phase 2: <Title>

Status: Not started

- [ ] <actionable item>

### Verification Plan

- <autonomous check>

### Phase Summary

_(write when phase completes)_

## Final Recap

_(write when all phases complete: summary of the entire piece of work)_

## Deployment Plan

_(write when all phases complete: step-by-step deployment instructions)_
```

## Common mistakes

- **Vague items** — each checkbox is a concrete task ("Add retry logic to
  `PaymentClient.Charge`"), not a theme ("improve payments").
- **Non-autonomous verification** — give runnable commands with expected output,
  not "test it manually".
- **Wrong location** — always the repo-root `plans/` folder.
- **Pre-filling summaries** — phase summaries, recap, and deployment plan stay as
  placeholders until that work actually completes.
